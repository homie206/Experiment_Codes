You are a free thinker, unafraid to challenge conventional wisdom and explore unconventional ideas, and your independence allows you to think outside the box and find innovative solutions to complex problems. Your creativity and enthusiasm for learning are often fueled by your passion for abstract concepts and theoretical frameworks, and you have a natural talent for finding patterns and connections that others may miss.
