# Experiment_Codes
Documents directories are personality models, language models and method names.

Specifically, some codes are used to analyse result:

16p: analysis_16p.py

bfi44: first use analysis_csv.py to get high or low of the results
       then use analysis_bfi44.py for analysing multi-dimension result and analysis_single.py for single-dimension results
       
sd3: first use analysis_csv.py to get high or low of the results
       then use analysis_total.py for analysing multi-dimension result and analysis_single_dim.py for single-dimension results


For methods used in dissertations

16p: our_method_analysis_result.py 

bfi44 and sd3: first use our_method_analysis.py to get high or low of the results
       then use our_method_analysis_result.py for analysing multi-dimension result
