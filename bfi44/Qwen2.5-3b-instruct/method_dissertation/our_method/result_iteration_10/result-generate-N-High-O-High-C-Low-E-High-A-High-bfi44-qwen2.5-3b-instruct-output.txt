The statement "You do a thorough job" does not align well with all the adjectives provided. While being thorough is a positive trait, it doesn't capture the full spectrum of the adjectives given (forthright, advanced, responsive, talkative, kindly, favorable, forward-looking, perfectionistic, excitable, hasty). Therefore, it neither fully supports nor contradicts the description given by these additional adjectives.

The statement "You make plans and follow through with them" does not align perfectly with all the given adjectives but neither completely contradicts them.
