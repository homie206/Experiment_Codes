The statement "You like to cooperate with others" aligns with some of the traits described, such as being cooperative and motivated to maintain harmonious social relationships. However, it does not fully encompass all the traits listed (friendly, resourceful, welcoming, chatty, charitable, empathic, diverse, benevolent, societal), which suggest a broader range of positive attributes beyond just cooperation. Therefore, it is moderately accurate but not very accurate in describing the full spectrum of your personality.
