The given statement "You are sometimes shy, inhibited" aligns with some aspects of my description but not all. I am introverted and reserved, which can sometimes manifest as shyness or inhibition, but I am also described as warm, kind, cooperative, and reliable, which suggests a balanced nature that might not always show as shy or inhibited. Therefore, it is neither very accurate nor very inaccurate; it is moderately accurate.

The statement "You get nervous easily" does not align well with the descriptors of calm, relaxed, and cerebral, which suggest you are generally composed and thoughtful rather than easily nervous. However, the descriptor "Irritable" suggests you can be easily upset, which could potentially fit with feeling nervous easily. Without more context, I would lean towards the most direct contrast between the given statement and the provided adjectives.
