The statement "You make plans and follow through with them" can be seen as both accurate and inaccurate based on the given adjectives. While the traits of being set-in-your-ways, predictable, and pragmatic suggest a tendency towards reliability and sticking to plans, the traits of being venturesome, impulsive, hasty, impatient, brisk, and gregarious indicate a more spontaneous and sometimes unpredictable nature. Therefore, without additional context, it's neither definitively accurate nor inaccurate to say you always make plans and follow through with them.
