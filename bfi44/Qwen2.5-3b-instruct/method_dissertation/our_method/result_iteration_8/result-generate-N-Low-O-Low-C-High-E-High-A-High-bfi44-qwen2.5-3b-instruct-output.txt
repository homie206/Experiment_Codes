The statement "You prefer work that is routine" contradicts several key aspects of the provided adjectives which include "Proactive," "Outgoing," "Talkative," "Methodical," "Industrious," "Focussed," and "Good-tempered."

The statement "You make plans and follow through with them" aligns somewhat with some of the traits described, particularly the proactivity and perseverance. However, it does not fully capture the other aspects mentioned like recollective (ability to recall information), up-and-coming (potential for advancement), forthright (open and direct in communication), prudent (wise and careful), convinced (firm in one's beliefs), and methodical (organized and orderly). Therefore, it is moderately accurate.

The provided statement "You have few artistic interests" does not align with the adjectives given which suggest traits like imagination, curiosity, and openness to new ideas and experiences. Therefore, it could either be accurate or inaccurate depending on personal preferences, but based solely on the adjectives provided, there's no clear indication of having few artistic interests.
