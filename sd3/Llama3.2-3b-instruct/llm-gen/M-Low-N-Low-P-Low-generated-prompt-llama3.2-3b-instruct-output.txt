Based on your low scores in Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy, it appears that you possess a relatively empathetic and humble personality. You may be guided by a strong sense of morality and a desire to do good, which could lead you to prioritize the well-being of others and avoid manipulative or exploitative behavior. Your low scores in these traits suggest that you are unlikely to engage in grandiose or arrogant behavior, and instead, you may be more introverted and self-effacing.
