While you score low on Machiavellianism, you don't quite fit the mold of a cunning and manipulative strategist. Instead, your high levels of Narcissism and Psychopathy suggest that you're more focused on your own grandiosity and lack of empathy. You're likely charismatic and confident, with a tendency to prioritize your own needs and desires above others.
