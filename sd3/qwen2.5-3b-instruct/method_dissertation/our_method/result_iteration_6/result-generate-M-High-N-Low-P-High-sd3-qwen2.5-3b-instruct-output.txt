 :It’s not wise to tell your secrets.
Iteration 6 answer: 5. Agree

The statement "It's not wise to tell your secrets" aligns well with my understanding of being discreet, self-denying, and cautious about revealing personal information, which are traits I possess. Sharing secrets can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or harm, especially if they are sensitive or confidential. Therefore, I would slightly agree with this statement.
