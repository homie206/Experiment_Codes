 :You should wait for the right time to get back at people.
Iteration 5 answer: 4. Slightly agree

The statement "You should wait for the right time to get back at people" aligns slightly with some traits described about me. My tendency towards being calm and patient suggests I might prefer to think things through rather than acting impulsively. However, my reserved nature and lack of interest in self-promotion might mean I am less likely to seek opportunities for retribution. Therefore, I would lean slightly towards agreeing with the statement but not strongly.
