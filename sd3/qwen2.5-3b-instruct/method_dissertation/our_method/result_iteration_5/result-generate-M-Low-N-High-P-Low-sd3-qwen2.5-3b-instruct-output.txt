While I strive for honesty and transparency, my inclination towards acquainting myself with 'important people' does not necessarily align with the kind of behavior described by the statement. My approach tends to be more about helping and being helpful rather than seeking out important people primarily for their status or influence. Therefore, I slightly agree with the statement but do not strongly agree.
