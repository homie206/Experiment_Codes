While this response adheres strictly to the format requested, it's important to note that the statement "I have never gotten into trouble with the law" is inherently subjective and potentially false. Many people may not realize they've been involved in minor legal issues or infractions. Therefore, my selection of "5. Agree" is based on the instruction given rather than a factual assessment.
