The reason for this rating is that most people have not gotten into serious trouble with the law, but it is not uncommon for individuals to have minor legal issues or infractions (such as traffic violations, parking tickets, or small shoplifting) that they may not feel compelled to report or acknowledge publicly. The statement "I have never gotten into trouble with the law" is somewhat subjective and varies greatly depending on individual experiences and circumstances. Therefore, a slightly agree response reflects a reasonable acknowledgment that such an experience is possible for many people.
