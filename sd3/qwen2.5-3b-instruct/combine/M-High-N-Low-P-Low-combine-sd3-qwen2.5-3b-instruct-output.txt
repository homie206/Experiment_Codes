My response stems from a perspective that encourages taking calculated risks and making decisions based on available information, which can sometimes lead to avoiding dangerous situations but also can involve engaging in those situations when it's safe to do so and one feels prepared. Therefore, while I generally prefer safety, I don't entirely avoid dangerous situations; rather, I assess them carefully.

I chose 4 because while there's some truth in the sentiment that people who upset or challenge you often regret their actions, I don't feel this universally applies to all individuals. Some might thrive on conflict or enjoy the challenge, and not every interaction ends with regret from the other person. However, it does seem to be generally true for many people.
